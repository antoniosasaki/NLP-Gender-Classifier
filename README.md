### A gender prediction study from census manuscript data
The Socface project brings together researchers to analyze French census records from 1836 to 1936.
They are using advanced technology to extract information from handwritten lists, but in certain censuses
gender information may be missing. Thus, as this is essential for other analyses, our objective in this work
is to use machine learning knowledge to develop a gender prediction model based on available data.
